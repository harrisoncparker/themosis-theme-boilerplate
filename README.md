Themosis Theme Boilerplate - Theme
==========================

This is a boilerplate theme for the [Themosis](https://github.com/themosis/themosis) 
Wordpress Framework. This theme was designed to be more prescriptive than the default 
one so my team and I could all be on the same page with regards to how we use themosis 
and to also to save some time in setup.

This is for Themosis 1.3 as many of the additions in this theme are present in 
the themosis 2.0 theme. That being said the main goal for this theme is to be 
opinionated and prescriptive so I probably will make one for 2.0 when ive had a chance 
to use it in a project

The main things this theme provides are:
- A basic Post model for all wordpress postTypes to be extended from.
- Models taken and adapted from the 
[wordpress-eloquent](https://github.com/drewjbartlett/wordpress-eloquent) project.
- A consistent folder structure within the `js` `sass` and `views` directories.
- A simple module system for javascript.
- Some helper methods for `js` `scss` and `php`.
- `laravel-mix` instead of `gulp`.
- Some examples of how to use bothe themosis core features and the features 
in this boilerplate.
